# Governance 

This document outlines the governance model for TresJS ecosystem. This is a living document and will be updated as the ecosystem evolves. It includes detailed descriptions of the different roles, nomination processes, code review processes and Code of Conduct enforcement.

## Get Involved

**Anything that supports the TresJS community is a valuable contribution.**

Contributions might come in different forms, they are all meaningful and valuable to the community.

- Reporting a bug (with a proper reproduction link ðŸ˜œ)
- Suggesting an enhancement

No contribution is too small, we are all here to learn and grow together.

You can contribute to TresJS no matter your engineering ability. Our goal is to recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.

### Level 2: Maintainer

The Maintainer role is available to contributors who want to join the team and take part in the long-term maintenance and growth of TresJS ecosystem.

This role is critical to TresJS long-term success and growth. Maintainers act as the public face of the project and are most likely to be your first point of contact when interacting with Discord or Github.

- See vote rules & requirements for info on how the vote works.

### Level 3: Core Maintainer

The **Core Maintainer** role is available to community members who have a larger-than-usual impact and commitment to the TresJS community and ecosystem. They are seen as leaders in the project and are listened to by the wider TresJS community. A Core memmber is recognized for contributing a significant amount of time and energy to the project through issues, pull requests, bug fixes, implementing advanced enhancements/features, and/or proactively providing feedback on RFCs.

### Level 4: Steward

The **Steward** is an additional role bestowed to 1 (or more) Core member of the project.

The role of Steward is mainly an administrative one. Stewards control and maintain sensitive project assets, assist in resolving conflicts, and act as tiebreakers in the event of disagreements.

In extremely rare cases, a Steward can act unilaterally when they believe it is in the project's best interest and can prove that the issue cannot be resolved through normal governance procedure. The steward must publicly state their reason for unilateral action before taking it.

The project Steward is currently [@alvarosabu](https://github.com/alvarosabu)

#### Privileges

- Access to `@tresjs` social media accounts
- Access to organization Netlify account
- Administrator privileges on the TresJs GitHub organization
- Administration privileges on the TresJS Discord server
- Publish access to all the organization's packages on NPM
- Domain registrant and DNS access to the `tresjs.org` domain and subdomains
- Ability to initiate a vote
- Ability to veto votes and resolve voting deadlocks
- Define project direction and planning
- Ability to decide on moderation decisions

#### Nomination

- Stewards cannot be self-nominated.
- Only Core members are eligible.
- New Stewards will be added based on a unanimous vote by the existing Steward(s).
- In the event that someone is unreachable then the decision will be deferred.


#### Retiring a Role (Alumni)

Contributor roles are granted for as long as the person wishes to engage with the project. However, over time an active community member may choose to step away from the TresJS ecosystem to work on other things. Moving on from a project is a natural and well-understood part of any open source community, and we celebrate it!

Alumni is a special designation and role for any person who was once an active maintainer (L2 or above) but is now no longer actively involved. By retiring and joining Alumni you trade-in your current set of roles, privileges, and responsibilities for a new, special Alumni role.

As a Maintainer (L2 or above) you can retire your role at any time by pinging the project Steward and requesting Alumni status. You can initiate this action yourself if you know ahead-of-time that you need to step away from the project.

If you are not actively contributing to TresJS's repositories or the TresJS community for longer than six months, the project Steward may proactively retire your role, designate you as a project alumnus, and notify you of the change.

As an Alumni member, you are still a part of the TresJS community and can continue to be a part of our Discord, GitHub, and anywhere else. You may also request to have your old roles reinstated at any time through the normal nomination & voting process for that role.

Rejoining the project as a contributor (L1 or above) will automatically remove you from the Alumni role.

# Governance Playbook

## Voting

Certain project decisions (like governance changes and membership nominations) require a vote. Below are the changes that require a vote, and the rules that govern that vote.

The project Steward may initiate a vote for any unlisted project decision. [General Rules](#general-voting-rules) will apply, along with any addition rules provided at the steward's discretion. If this unlisted project decision is expected to be repeated in the future, voting rules should be agreed on and then added to this document.

### General Voting Rules

- Members may abstain from any vote.
- Members who do not vote within 5 days will automatically abstain.
- Stewards may reduce the 5 day automatic abstain for urgent decisions.
- Stewards reserve the right to veto approval with a publicly disclosed reason.

## Voting: Governance Change

A vote is initiated once a pull request to the GOVERNANCE.md file is submitted by a Core Member.

If the pull request submitter is not a Core Member, the PR can be closed by any Maintainer without a vote. However, any Core Member may request a vote on that PR, in which case a vote is initiated.

**Who can vote:** Core members (L3 and above). All Maintainers are encouraged to discuss and voice their opinion in the pull request discussion. Core members should take the opinions of Maintainers into consideration when voting.

1. The pull request discussion thread is used to discuss the governance change.
2. The normal 5 day voting & discussion window begins with either the PR creation or the removal of `WIP:` from the PR title if the PR was created as a draft.
3. Voting can be done in the pull request via a review of either **Approve (For)** or **Change Requested (Against)**.
4. The vote must receive a simple majority (50%+) to pass.
5. **If the vote passes** the PR is merged and the changes take effect immediately.
